class_name AnchoredRigidBody3D
extends RigidBody3D

## This is a node that when moved will create an anchor to save its position
## to ensure it remains in that physical space (RigidBody3D addition).
## When the user recenters the anchor position should automatically update.
## If persistent anchors are supported, the anchor location will be stored
## and recreated the next time the application starts.
## If shared anchors are supported, the anchor will be duplicated on other
## devices in the group.
