class_name AnchoredAnimatableBody3D
extends AnimatableBody3D

## This is a node that when moved will create an anchor to save its position
## to ensure it remains in that physical space (AnimatableBody3D addition).
## When the user recenters the anchor position should automatically update.
## If persistent anchors are supported, the anchor location will be stored
## and recreated the next time the application starts.
## If shared anchors are supported, the anchor will be duplicated on other
## devices in the group.

## If this is an object without an anchor,
## we reset its position if needed.
@export var reset_on_drop : bool = true

## Use can add this to the trash can (and delete the anchor)
@export var can_trash : bool = true

## If true we can only have one instance of this,
## the last one added will be kept.
@export var is_unique : bool = false

## Dictionary of nodes that must be unique
